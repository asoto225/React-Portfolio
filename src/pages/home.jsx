            <h3 className="subTitle">Full Stack Developer</h3>
            <p>I am passionate and dedicated full-stack developer who recently completed an intensive coding bootcamp. My journey into the world 
                of coding began with a thirst for knowledge and a drive to turn ideas into functional, user-friendly applications. <br />
                During the bootcamp, I immersed myself in a wide array of technologies, gaining proficiency in both front-end and back-end development. 
                From crafting engaging user interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to building robust server-side applications with technologies like Node.js and Express, 
                I've honed my skills to create seamless and efficient digital experiences. <br />
                I have a keen eye for detail and a commitment to writing clean, maintainable code. I thrive in collaborative environments where creative problem-solving and 
                teamwork are valued. Throughout the bootcamp, I tackled real-world projects that provided me with hands-on experience in solving complex problems and delivering solutions 
                that meet both user needs and business goals. <br />
                My toolbox includes a range of technologies, such as React for building dynamic front-end interfaces, MongoDB for database management, and a host of other tools that empower 
                me to bring ideas to life. I'm always eager to stay on the cutting edge of technology, keeping pace with industry trends and incorporating the latest advancements into my work. <br />
                Beyond coding, I bring effective communication skills and a proactive approach to project management. I understand the importance of collaboration in achieving successful outcomes,
                 and I'm ready to contribute my skills to a dynamic and innovative team.</p>
